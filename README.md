## Maintenance
This is a simple sample Web Api 2 example of an automobile maintenance api, using AngularJS as the front end.
* the C# Web Api is fully unit tested
* this is my first time trying Angular so it's not tested, and the code isn't the best

## How To run:
* Open the sln file in Visual Studio 2015 (You can use the community edition for free)
* On the top menu click Tests -> All Tests
* On the top menu click Tests -> Window -> Test Explorer to see the test results
* Then you can run the app Debug -> Start Debugging
* Visual Studio will spin up an IISExpress web server
* The data is stored in memory and there is some data for you to play around with, but when you shut down the app, you will lose all of your new data
